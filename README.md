# Bladder Cancer RNA-Seq Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze RNA-Seq gene expression data from the TCGA-BLCA dataset to uncover differentially expressed genes between normal and tumor samples of bladder cancer. Insights gained from this project could provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer.

## Dataset
The data was sourced from the TCGA-BLCA dataset, focusing on mRNA data. After preprocessing, filtering, and normalization, the data was ready for downstream analysis, including differential gene expression analysis.

## Objectives
- To preprocess and normalize RNA-Seq data effectively.
- To perform exploratory data analysis and quality control.
- To identify differentially expressed genes between normal and tumor bladder tissue.
- To interpret the biological significance of findings and link them to known bladder cancer studies.

## Tools and Technologies
- R and Bioconductor for comprehensive RNA-Seq data analysis.
- TCGAbiolinks package for downloading TCGA data.
- Packages for quality control, normalization, and differential expression analysis (specify the packages used, e.g., DESeq2, edgeR).
